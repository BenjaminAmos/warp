# Warp
## Overview
This module implements the warp faction for Destination Sol.
It introduces three new ships, the scout, the explorer, the endeavour and the quasar, as well as the warp starting station.

You can find more information about the ships in the [documentation](docs/ships.md).

## Requirements
***At current, the proper functioning of this module relies on some additional code being added to the engine.
You can clone the required version of the engine from the
"[gestalt-code-modules](https://github.com/BenjaminAmos/DestinationSol/tree/gestalt-code-modules)" branch of my fork.***

***Trying to run this without those changes has not been tested and is likely to not work at all.***
